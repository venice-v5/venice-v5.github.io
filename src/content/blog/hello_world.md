Venice is a fully open-source Python runtime for VEX V5 robots. It lets you divide your project up into separate files, and features its own custom API and async scheduler.

Under the hood, Venice is built with the Rust programming language and runs on MicroPython's VM. Unlike VEXcode, Venice compiles Python programs ahead of time, which means faster loading times and opportunities for performance optimization.

Venice is entirely open source. Anybody is welcome to explore the code, open issues, or contribute new features on GitHub: [https://github.com/venice-v5/venice]
